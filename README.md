# My Personal Project

## By Andy Huang

My ***application*** will allow me to:
- create songs and playlists
- organize songs by putting them into these playlists
- download/stream songs

People who like listening to music will use my application, myself included. This project is of interest to me because 
music is a large part of my life, and I wanted to create an application that relates to something I hold dear to myself.

## User Stories

*Phase 1*:
- As a user, I want to be able to create a new song
- As a user, I want to be able to add a song to a playlist
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a song from a playlist
- As a user, I want to be able to view the songs in a playlist

*Phase 2*:
- As a user, I want to be able to save my account to file
- As a user, I want to be able to load my account from file

*Phase 4*: *Task 2*
- I have chosen to design my Song class as a robust class

*Phase 4*: *Task 3*
- I would not refactor to improve my design because I believe my current class design adheres to the single responsibility and coupling rules well
